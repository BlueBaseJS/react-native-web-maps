Hey! Thanks for checking out this package ðŸ’ª

The goal of this package is adding web support to [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps). This package currently adds support for almost all of `react-native-maps` components. Most of the important methods and props are supported, and all of the methods marked as `deprecated` by `react-native-maps` are currently not supported.

I have some ideas to bring some web apis to `react-native` but I still have to decide whether to create a new package and add these new APIs or re export them from `react-native-maps` through this package or trying to add them to `react-native-maps`. The last option I think it wont be possible. By these web APIs I mean for example marker clustering, drawing manager, editable polygons, etc.

## Trying it out

If you want to try this out I recommend cloning the [example](https://github.com/teovillanueva/react-native-web-maps/tree/main/example) and running it âœ¨
